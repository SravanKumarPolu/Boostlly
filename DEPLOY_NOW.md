# 🚨 URGENT: Deploy Updated Build Now!

## The Problem
Your localhost and deployed versions are showing **different quotes** because:
- ✅ **Localhost** has the latest build with deterministic quote selection
- ❌ **Deployed version** still has the old random quote selection

## The Solution
You need to deploy the fresh build that was created at **22:32** today.

## 🚀 Deploy Steps

### Option 1: Netlify Drop (Recommended)
1. **Open:** https://app.netlify.com/drop
2. **Drag & drop this folder:** `/Users/sravanpolu/Projects/Boostlly/apps/web/out`
3. **Wait 1-2 minutes** for deployment

### Option 2: Netlify Sites Dashboard
1. **Visit:** https://app.netlify.com/sites/boostlly/deploys
2. **Click:** "Deploy manually"
3. **Upload:** The `out` folder from `/Users/sravanpolu/Projects/Boostlly/apps/web/out`

## ✅ After Deployment
Both localhost and deployed will show the **same quote** because:
- Both use date-based selection: `(dayOfYear * 7 + year * 3 + month * 5 + day * 11) % 1000`
- Today's date (Oct 15, 2025) will always produce the same quote index
- No more random differences!

## 🔍 Test After Deployment
1. **Check localhost:** http://localhost:3000
2. **Check deployed:** https://boostlly.netlify.app
3. **Both should show IDENTICAL quotes!**

## 📋 Quick Copy Path
